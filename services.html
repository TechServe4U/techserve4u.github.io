                                            practicing and participating in the group meetings. when a mentor is a such
                                            dedication to our success, success will be a must in Sha Allah. Many people

                                            complete their course. The Founder / Instructor's message was very
                                            straightforward to potential candidates. He will show them how to achieve
                                            their dreams if they are willing to make a serious commitment, properly
                                            communicate, and learn how to collaborate.
                                            • They create an equal opportunity for those who never worked in corporate
                                            culture, and for those with years of professional experience with (I.T and
                                            Non-IT Background). So there is room for all.
                                            • Approx. 98% of those enrolled speak Bangla and English, so you may have
                                            some benefit communicating with a team-mate in your own language. However,
                                            the programs are not only designed for those of Bangladeshi Origins. All
                                            workshops are done in English.
                                            • It is very cost-effective, and they are always willing to work with you
                                            during hardship.
                                            • They will literally babysit you for the first few months, but eventually,
                                            you will have to get serious and learn. There is no crystal ball waiting for
                                            you on the other end. You only get out what you put into it. If you are
                                            looking for a shortcut to I.T then you may want to take a different route.
                                            Lastly, when you are comparing other institutions, please know the
                                            difference between Training and Transformation. Thanks!

                                            What I understand from TechServe4u that there is an actual engineer who is
                                            willingly mentoring you step by step. This Techserve4u is not like another
                                            education training or campus.

                                            really helpful when you know something and also test out how much do you
                                            know. I understand that the tech industry could be savage but you have to
                                            start somewhere. Somewhere they will teach you how to resolve a problem and
                                            help build a great relationship with the team. In the future, I know for

                                        <p>I believe Unique strategy of TechServe4u will help most of the students to
                                            achieve their goal.

                                            <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseExample8" role="button"
                                                aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample8">
                                                See More
                                            </a>
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="collapse" id="collapseExample8">
                                            Constant push from the institute makes a student more
                                            motivated and committed for their course work. I am currently enrolled in
                                            the DevOps course offered by TechServe4u and simply loving it. Instructor
                                            has immense knowledge of computer science and software engineering. And the
                                            way whole course curriculum is designed, it will not only help any student
                                            overcome their weaknesses but will also help building clear concepts about
                                            the topics. Finally I would say, if you are looking to advance your career
                                            in IT sector and searching for any forum or institute to be connected to
                                            then give TechServe4u a try. I am confident you won't regret the decision.

                                        <p>After thorough research, I had chosen TechServe4U over several other
                                            institutions for the following reasons:

                                            <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseExample9" role="button"
                                                aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample9">
                                                See More
                                            </a>
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="collapse" id="collapseExample9">
                                            • Unlike every I.T School / Recruiter out there, they were not selling
                                            dreams and telling everyone will have a six-figure income after they
                                            complete their course. The Founder / Instructor's message was very
                                            straightforward to potential candidates. He will show them how to achieve
                                            their dreams if they are willing to make a serious commitment, properly
                                            communicate, and learn how to collaborate.
                                            • They create an equal opportunity for those who never worked in a corporate
                                            culture, and for those with years of professional experience with (I.T and
                                            Non-IT Background). So there is room for all.
                                            • Approx. 98% of those enroll speak Banlga and English, so you may have some
                                            benefit communicating with a team-mate in your own language. However, the
                                            programs are not only designed for those of Bangladeshi Origins. All
                                            workshops are done in English.
                                            • It is very cost-effective, and they are always willing to work with you
                                            during hardship.
                                            • They will literally babysit you for first few months, but eventually you
                                            will have to get serious and learn. There is no crystal ball waiting for you
                                            on the other end. You only get out what you put into it. If you are looking
                                            for a shortcut to I.T then you may want to take a different route. Lastly,
                                            when you are comparing other institutions, please know the difference
                                            Training and Transformation. Thanks!
