                            <p>Our story starts with the realistic thought of readiness - from a rookie to a pro, a
                                bookish to on
                                and off-field expert.</p>
                            <p>We have observed versatile individuals failing in their lives. They wanted to win but
                                didn’t know how
                                to do that. Slowly, they lost themselves in the crowd. </p>
                            <p>Our pathfinder and leader, Mr. Shiblu Ahmad, is a long-term experienced engineer. He was
                                once an
                                employee of another organization. Later, he had the vision to make the people dreaming,
                                transforming
                                the dream into reality, and give support all the time. </p>
                            <p>Mr. Ahmad has seen many people seeking a better place where they can learn and implement
                                the ideas
                                practically. As most of the training centers just “SELL” their courses to the students,
                                he started
                                to work differently and uniquely. </p>
                            <p> He was not up to showing unfeasible dreams, illusions. All the focuses were on
                                “Workforce Readiness”
                                instead of the so-called “Training.”</p>
                            <p><b>As a result, Tech Serve4 U, LLC. was born!</b></p>

                                            <p>Tech Serve4 U has started its journey in 2013. It was potentially
                                                growing from the
                                                small team
                                                of
                                                3-4 members. The team was enthusiastic about generating ideas on
                                                developing
                                                programs,

                                                applications like FindMe and Field Force. These apps have
